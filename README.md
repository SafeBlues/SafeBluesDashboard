# SafeBluesDashboard
SafeBluesDashboard is an interactive dashboard for the [Safe Blues](https://safeblues.org)
campus experiment at the University of Auckland City Campus. This experiment involved the
simulation of several simultaneous real-world epidemics by spreading safe virtual
virus-like tokens (or strands) between participating smartphones. The resulting statistics
on the transmission of these virtual viruses throughout the experiment's duration are
available through this dashboard.
